## Bedy Mod Edit 




BUGS


## Immediate todo 
  - add a btn to spawn a zone with a particular name

- add a btn to export a zone while it is selected in the hierarchy 


- when a zone is the active zone, doodads placed will be placed as children of it . 




- in terrain crate, give name component to my terrain and chunk 




## LATER 
- add grid locking to translation

- add random rot and scale checkboxes (add controls in doodad window for this ?  or window at bottom )
