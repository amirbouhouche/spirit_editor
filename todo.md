## Bedy Mod Edit 




BUGS


## Immediate todo 
  

  - if a gltf is missing, render a purple cube or whatever 

  - make the manifest file specify the model type as an enum so we can render other things like shapes ?

 


- ** in terrain crate, give name component to my terrain and chunk 




## LATER 
- add grid locking to translation

- add random rot and scale checkboxes (add controls in doodad window for this ?  or window at bottom )
