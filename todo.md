## Immediate todo 

 

 1. add more   texture to clay tiles

- remember can  handle controls better  by  using bevy_editor_pls/src/controls.rs




- allow for disable shadows in editor ??

- add doodad bundles (house) 

-  add snap dimensions 

- when cloning an asset, auto select the new clone 

- clean up code / refactor (pls as base ? ) (less hacking of hierarchy ?)
 
 
## LATER  


- BIG  upgrade to UI -- put ui tools in Root and get rid of egui (PLS) 

-build a separate ActiveZone window (click to select active zone) - dont use hierarchy for this
