## Bevy Mesh Terrain Editor

- maybe perform the loading in discrete well-defined stages ?
- synty swamp has an issue with texcoords 


## Immediate todo 

- add visual grid snap dimensions (0.14 has grid gizmo)


- remember can  handle controls better  by  using bevy_editor_pls/src/controls.rs




- allow for disable shadows in editor ??

- add doodad bundles (house) 

-  add snap dimensions 

- when cloning an asset, auto select the new clone 

- clean up code / refactor (pls as base ? ) (less hacking of hierarchy ?)
