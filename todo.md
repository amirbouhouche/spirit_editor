## Bevy Mesh Terrain Editor

- bug: cant select units ? 
 
 
- synty swamp has an issue with texcoords ?


## Immediate todo 


- xform the clay tile by its origin and pass that offset into the mesh gen 

-tool mode to edit height of a tile / select a tile
-make SaveAll save all zones 
 

- add visual grid snap dimensions (0.14 has grid gizmo)


- remember can  handle controls better  by  using bevy_editor_pls/src/controls.rs




- allow for disable shadows in editor ??

- add doodad bundles (house) 

-  add snap dimensions 

- when cloning an asset, auto select the new clone 

- clean up code / refactor (pls as base ? ) (less hacking of hierarchy ?)
 
 
## LATER  


- BIG  upgrade to UI -- put ui tools in Root and get rid of egui (PLS)
- Move all doodads code to root, all zones code

-build a separate ActiveZone window (click to select active zone) - dont use hierarchy for this
