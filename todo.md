## Bedy Mod Edit 




BUGS

- clicking on a doodad should select it ... ? 




## Immediate todo 
 
 
- mod editor PLS so there is a tab at the bottom that lets me drag and drop manifested doodads to the terrain . 
	- create a manifest file ... in assets... a RON ...
	- read it on boot and spawn entities for each one -- test get rendered as icons in the UI  (similar to unreal) 
	- drag and drop the icons onto the terrain triggers a 'spawn scene entity' event -> this spawns a scene entity
